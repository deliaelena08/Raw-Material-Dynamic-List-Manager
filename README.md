# Raw-Material-Dynamic-List-Manager
An aplication implemented in C for my classes,in which i have a list of struct of objects allocated dynamically  with some functionalities like: add, filtre, delete, modify, sort, undo etc. Sorry for the confusion of the name but i have done it on a friend's laptop named Sergiu :).
